Run Time: 56 min
Genre(s): Pop, R&b, Ambient, Electronic

Happier Than Ever is a great follow up to Eilish's debut album and expands upon the same sounds present there, whilst still switching things up enough to be a breath of fresh air. The album consists of amazing pop bops, mellow r&b and ballads, sometimes crossing over into eachother in the very same song. Eilish really leans more into r&b in this album, with some mellow vocals and synthpop base present every other track. The album is less bombastic than her previous one, but in a good way. It might sound like the album is playing it safe, but there's definitely some pretty unique experimental soundscapes for a pop-record. The opener: "I didn't change my number" is a statement to this, ending the track with some really ominous, distorted synths which clash with the mellow sound of the rest of the song. There's also plenty of pretty ballads present here. 

The album suffers slightly from repetitiveness due to its long runtime of 56 min. Especially some of the ballads were redundant in my opinion.

Final rating: B+
Favorite Songs: I didn't change my number, Billie Bossa Nova, My future, OverHeated, NDA

### 20: Slow Crush - Hush

Run Time: 45 min
Genre(s): Rock, Shoegaze, Dream Pop

_Hush_ is the second album by thee Belgian based shoegaze band _Slow Crush_. Following up their beloved debut album, _Aurora_, Slow Crush swings for the fences with Hush, leaning more heavily into the slowcore and dream pop elements of their music, giving us a serene soundscape. In return they forego some of their punk influences, resulting in a much mellower album. I must admit, I miss a little of that punk edge which was present in Aurora, now only present in one song, _Swoon_. 

Your stomach for meandering, reverb laden waves of sound washing over you will determine if you'll enjoy this album. At the very least I recommend giving the title track: _Hush_ a listen. I feel like I can just about drown in that one. 

Final Rating: A-
Favorite Songs: Hush, Swoon, Lull, Blue, Gloom

### 19: Blu - The Color Blu(e)

Run Time: 43 min
Genre(s): Hiphop, Jazz-Rap

No, I did not mess up the resolution, the albumcover is just blurry.

What is there to say about Blu that hasn't been said before? He's been a big name in the abstract hiphop scene since 2007 and keeps impressing and improving. The Color Blu(e) is just a crispy and plain fun hiphop album. Blu's rapping prowess is up there amongst the best, his lyrics are fun as heck and his production is just a-m-a-z-i-n-g. The jazz-influences in his songs are tasty and not overbearing, and range from subtle moody horn to full on swing quartet. 

I suppose in the end we must ask ourselves only two questions when it comes to this album: 
How did this man:
1) Clear a Beatles sample for this album?
2) and make it absolutely slap in a hiphop context?

Final Rating: A-
Favorite Songs: People Call Me Blu(e), Because The Sky Is Blu(e), Everyday Blu(e)s, Mr. Blu(e)

### 18: Weezer - OK Human

Run Time: 30 min
Genre(s): Pop, Rock

No, it doesn't sound anything like OK computer. If anything it's a wink with both eyes at the same time to Radiohead. 

Anyways, one second: WEEZER IS BACK, BABYYYY.

Honestly, this is just a short and sweet little pop project, tastefully executed by one of the most cherished poprock bands in the world. What more can you ask for? Some tasty guitars, synths and violins, paired with Cuomo's (somehow!) never ageing voice. The lyrics are fun and simple, just like they were in 1994. Listen to this if you just want to have a good time.

Final Rating: A-
Favorite Songs: Numbers, Grapes Of Wrath, Aloo Gobi, Playing My Piano, Here Comes The Rain
