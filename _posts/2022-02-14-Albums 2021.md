Run Time: 56 min
Genre(s): Pop, R&b, Ambient, Electronic

Happier Than Ever is a great follow up to Eilish's debut album and expands upon the same sounds present there, whilst still switching things up enough to be a breath of fresh air. The album consists of amazing pop bops, mellow r&b and ballads, sometimes crossing over into eachother in the very same song. Eilish really leans more into r&b in this album, with some mellow vocals and synthpop base present every other track. The album is less bombastic than her previous one, but in a good way. It might sound like the album is playing it safe, but there's definitely some pretty unique experimental soundscapes for a pop-record. The opener: "I didn't change my number" is a statement to this, ending the track with some really ominous, distorted synths which clash with the mellow sound of the rest of the song. There's also plenty of pretty ballads present here. The album suffers slightly from repetitiveness due to its long runtime of 56 min. Especially some of the ballads were redundant in my opinion.

Final rating: B+
Favorite Songs: I didn't change my number, Billie Bossa Nova, My future, OverHeated, NDA
