## 21 Best Albums of 2021! 

First blog post! 

I've taken the liberty to share some of my favorite albums of 2021 with you, so that you may enjoy them just like I have. I've given the albums genre tags and "energy levels" (read: how busy the album sounds), so that you can check out albums which share your preferences.

With that out of the way! Some honourable mentions that just didn't make the cut (but are definitely worth checking out!): 

God is an Astronaut - Ghost Tapes (Post-Rock, Post-Metal)  
Puntjudith - Snelweg (EP) (Pop, R&b)  
The Killers - Pressure Machine (Folk, Rock)  
R.A.P. Ferreira - The Light Emitting Diamond Cutter Scriptures (Hiphop, Jazz-Rap)  
Not Wonk - Dimen (Alternative Rock, Jpunk)  

Now onto the top 21 of 2021!

##  21: Billie Eilish - Happier Than Ever
![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dbqgwcoce/image/upload/v1645002311/550x551_ot6ghz.png)

Run Time: 56 min  
Genre(s): Pop, R&b, Ambient, Electronic  
Energy level: ★★

Happier Than Ever is a great follow up to Eilish's debut album and expands upon the same sounds present there, whilst still switching things up enough to be a breath of fresh air. The album consists of amazing pop bops, mellow r&b and ballads, sometimes crossing over into eachother in the very same song. Eilish really leans more into r&b in this album, with some mellow vocals and synthpop base present every other track. The album is less bombastic than her previous one, but in a good way. It might sound like the album is playing it safe, but there's definitely some pretty unique experimental soundscapes for a pop-record. The opener: "I didn't change my number" is a statement to this, ending the track with some really ominous, distorted synths which clash with the mellow sound of the rest of the song. There's also plenty of pretty ballads present here. 

The album suffers slightly from repetitiveness due to its long runtime of 56 min. Especially some of the ballads were redundant in my opinion.

Final rating: B+  
Favorite Songs: I didn't change my number, Billie Bossa Nova, My future, OverHeated, NDA



##  20: Slow Crush - Hush
![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dbqgwcoce/image/upload/v1645003844/slowcrush_cu6dbm.png)

Run Time: 45 min  
Genre(s): Rock, Shoegaze, Dream Pop  
Energy Level: ★★

Hush is the second album by the Belgian based shoegaze band; Slow Crush. Following up their beloved debut album, Aurora, Slow Crush swings for the fences with Hush, leaning more heavily into the slowcore and dream pop elements of their music, giving us a serene soundscape. In return they forego some of their punk influences, resulting in a much mellower album. I must admit, I miss a little of that punk edge which was present in Aurora, now only present in one song, Swoon. 

Your stomach for meandering, reverb laden waves of sound washing over you will determine if you'll enjoy this album. At the very least I recommend giving the title track: Hush a listen. I feel like I can just about drown in that one.

Final Rating: A-  
Favorite Songs: Hush, Swoon, Lull, Blue, Gloom

##  19: Blu - The Color Blu(e)
![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dbqgwcoce/image/upload/v1645005726/blu_edasns.png)

Run Time: 43 min  
Genre(s): Hiphop, Jazz-Rap  
Energy Level: ★★★

No, I did not mess up the resolution, the albumcover is just blurry.

What is there to say about Blu that hasn't been said before? He's been a big name in the abstract hiphop scene since 2007 and keeps impressing and improving. The Color Blu(e) is just a crispy and plain fun hiphop album. Blu's rapping prowess is up there amongst the best, his lyrics are fun as heck and his production is just a-m-a-z-i-n-g. The jazz-influences in his songs are tasty and not overbearing, and range from subtle moody horn to full on swing quartet. 

I suppose in the end we must ask ourselves only two questions when it comes to this album: 
How did this man:
1) Clear a Beatles sample for this album?
2) and make it absolutely slap in a hiphop context?

Final Rating: A-  
Favorite Songs: People Call Me Blu(e), Because The Sky Is Blu(e), Everyday Blu(e)s, Mr. Blu(e)

##  18: Weezer - OK Human
![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dbqgwcoce/image/upload/v1645006335/weezer_lu0con.png)

Run Time: 30 min  
Genre(s): Pop, Rock  
Energy Level: ★★★


Honestly, this is just a short and sweet little pop project, tastefully executed by one of the most cherished poprock bands in the world. What more can you ask for? Some tasty guitars, synths and violins, paired with Cuomo's (somehow!) never ageing voice. The lyrics are fun and simple, just like they were in 1994. Listen to this if you just want to have a good time.

Final Rating: A-  
Favorite Songs: Numbers, Grapes Of Wrath, Aloo Gobi, Playing My Piano, Here Comes The Rain

##  17: Godspeed You! Black Emperor - G_d's Pee AT STATE'S END!
![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dbqgwcoce/image/upload/v1645006853/GY_BE_pdlovu.png)

Run Time: 52 Min  
Genre(s): Post-Rock, Ambient, Drone, Field Recording  
Energy Level: ★★

GY!BE have succeed again in creating a soundtrack for the apocalypse. Not many bands can claim the legendary status of Godspeed You! Black Emperor, having released some of the most critically acclaimed rock albums of the late 90s and early 2000s and paving the way for the future of the whole genre of post-rock.

This album is a bit on the lighter side compared to their old stuff, taking more influences from traditional rock and blues into their music, and sparsing out the post-crock crescendo's with some ambient and field recording material. Therefore it's definitely a good entry point for people not accustomed with them or post-rock in general. By far the best song on the album is the dark and brooding: GOVERNMENT CAME. It just hits that spot their first two albums did, and especially gives an F#A#infinity vibe. Some tracks such as First Of The Last Glaciers even have a surprisingly 70's prog and pysch rock sound to them. All around a great album with many different stylistic influences and a good return to form.

Final Rating: A-  
Favorite Songs: GOVERNMENT CAME, Job’s Lament, First of the Last Glaciers, cliffs’ gaze at empty waters’ rise

##  16: Bastarda & João de Sousa - Fado

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dbqgwcoce/image/upload/v1645093745/fado_btg99e.png)

Run Time: 43 min  
Genre(s): Chamber Music, Portuguese Folk Music, Fado, Modern Classical  
Energy Level: ★★

Composer Bastarda and guitarist and vocalist De Sousa have made quite the incredible arrangement on this album. A calm but ominous Fado styled folk album, with lush strings giving the whole album a much grander scale. The elements of modern classical are subdued, but very pleasant to the ears. Though for me, clarinetists Michał Górczyński and Paweł Szamburski are the real stars of this album. I'd never really paid much mind to the bass and contrabass clarinet, but this album made me fall in love with the sound of them. The only real complaint I have with this album is the volume mixing, with some songs ranging from being hardly audible to blowing-out-your-eardrums. Not all of the songs have this problem, but at least a few do.

Final Rating: A-  
Favorite Songs: Livre, Estranha De Vida, Cantiga De Amigo, Medo

##  15: Pærish - Fixed It All
![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dbqgwcoce/image/upload/v1645094806/paerish_chgnjb.png)

Run Time: 39 min  
Genre(s): Pop Punk  
Energy Level: ★★★★

Pop-Punk? In this economy?!

Yes, apparently good pop-punk can exist beyond the early 2000's. I'm not an angsty teenager today, so I can't truly sing my heart out to edgy lyrics anymore, at least not shamelessly. The sound of pop-punk however is one I come back to every once in a while just for the fun of it.

First of all this album is just that, fun. Is it tacky? Sure. Is it borrowing from every other pop-punk song in existence? Sure, but you can't expect every pop-punk album to be as groundbreaking as The Black Parade. Then what is this album? This album just throws bop after bop at you unapologically, taking all the best parts of pop-punk and combining them. If anything what sets it apart against most pop-punk nowadays is that it feels genuine. It doesn't really feel like as soulless nostalgia bait, but rather as an homage to the genre. The instrumentation is lush and surprisingly complex in certain solos. Sometimes I even get a little jpunk vibes from the guitar, like in the song "Water Doctor". I think what will make or break the album for you is the vocals. I wasn't sold on them immediately, finding them a little bland, but they really grew on me overtime. 

Final Rating: A-  
Favorite Songs: Archives, Journey Of The Prairie King, Albert Suffers, Water Doctor

##  14: Alfa Mist - Bring Backs
![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dbqgwcoce/image/upload/v1645095226/alfamist_zgyyf9.png)

Run Time: 39 min  
Genre(s): Jazz-Fusion, Neosoul  
Energy Level: ★★★

Alfa Mist? More like Alfa doesn't miss.

Jokes aside, Alfa Mist just keeps Jazz-fusion sounding fresh and accessible at the same time. I appreciate that Bring Backs, whilst showing apt amounts of technical skill, does not fall into the sound of excess which jazz-fusion often does. Nowhere in the album do I have to sit through 20 minutes of saxophone, piano and guitar fighting for best solo. I think the only song which I found a bit too busy and masturbatory was the opening song, "Teki". Except for that one, I can listen to the album in the background for low concentration tasks as well as the foreground, which is a feat not much jazz-fusion manages to accomplish (or doesn't want to accomplish). 

So that must mean it's boring? Not at all. It's definitely subdued, but it's fresh, complex and sounds new.

Final Rating: A-  
Favorite Songs: All  
Least Favorite Song: Teki

##  13: Arooj Aftab - Vulture Prince
![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dbqgwcoce/image/upload/v1645095707/arooj_yz231b.png)

Run Time: 46 min  
Genre(s): Pakistani Folk, Chamber Folk, Chamber Jazz, Singer-Songwriter  
Energy Level: ★

parse; simplistic and extremely intimate. Arooj Aftab is genuinely one of the best vocalists I've heard in a while, and the sparse pakistina folk and subtle jazz instrumentation just makes her voice stand out that much more. The chamber folk angle on the album makes it sound really intimate, almost as if you're in the room with her. This album doesn't really have any "hits" or "bops", but rather a whole lot of slow and beautiful music. I'd recommend this when you're just lying in bed reading a book or contemplating the world around you.

Final Rating: A  
Favorite songs: All (and every album henceforth will be the same)

### 12: ALI - Love, Music and Dance

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dbqgwcoce/image/upload/v1645096198/Naamloos_qdtvog.png)

Run Time: 30 min  
Genre(s): Japanese Hip Hop, Jazz-Funk, Acid Jazz, Disco, Japanese Folk  
Energy Level: ★★★★

Japan based artist ALI has come out with an aptly named album called "Love, Music and Dance". The instrumentation is complex with multiple impressive solos and layered lushly. I think at any given time you hear at least four or five instruments. The album draws heavily from Japanese Hiphop, Japanese City Pop and even some Japanese folk, combining it with more western sounding jazz-funk and disco sounds. 

There honestly is not much to review here, I think you either "get it" or you "don't get it" (and I hate talking about things in that way). The overly joyous sounding combination of hiphop, jazz, funk and disco either gets you to dance (or at the very least bop your head) or you'll roll your eyes. 

Final Rating: A  

##  11: Dreamwell - Modern Grotesque
![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dbqgwcoce/image/upload/v1645096937/moderngrotesque_ec0ywz.png)


Run Time: 38 min  
Genre(s): Punk, Post-Hardcore, Screamo, Post-Rock  
Energy Level: ★★★★★

One of the finest post-hardcore releases in recent memory. First I'd like to draw attention to the lyrics which are just superb. Modern Grotesque tackles philosophy in a non-pseudo-intellectuel manner. It all comes off as very genuine and the philosophical depths, while not THAT deep or complex, still add a lot of meaning and emotion to the songs. These themes are then blended in some pretty neat (and sometimes cryptic) poetry.

The instrumental expertise on Modern Grotesque is up there with the best of the best in the post-hardcore world. Some of the more mellow rock and post-rock passages go over especially well in between the emotional devastation, and offer some well deserved breathers. Next up the vocals: Ranging from absolutely emotionally wretched screams to fragile singing, they tie the whole thing together brilliantly. 

Final Rating: A  

##  10: Ethereal Shroud - Trisagion
![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dbqgwcoce/image/upload/v1645097298/trisagion_hcf6nt.png)

Run Time: 64 min  
Genre(s): Atmospheric Black Metal, Symphonic Doom Metal  
Energy Level: ★★★★

The first metal release in the top 21!

Trisagion is a project by multi-instrumentalist Joe Hawker, consisting of only three songs, ranging in length from 13 minutes to a 27 minute epic. Unlike its predecessor album, "Trisagion" doesnt revolve around repetition as cathartic element, but focuses its writing on progressive structures. Joe Hawker is able to construct a dynamic & elaborate path for the emotional, enveloping & contemplative melodies & atmospheres. If anything, this album is extremely un-like a lot of black metal in that there are frequent BPM and key changes, with varying song structures. Every song on here feels like going on a journey. I find the album has the best of both worlds when it comes to black metal: hard hitting riffs and merciless drums, with some lush and atmospheric reverb. 

Also damn those vocals are good.

Final Rating: A  

##  09: King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard - LW
![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dbqgwcoce/image/upload/v1645098157/LW_bdzaee.png)

Run time: 42 min   
Genre(s): Psych rock, microtonal rock  
Energy Level: ★★

The sister album to K.G, but just a bit better in my opinion. I feel like at this point KG&LW have really perfected their craft with microtonal music. The album mixes the anatolian sounding scales they've become known for with some funky and electronic elements. It works really well. I'd say it's one of a kind, but you have K.G. and Flying microtonal Banana to listen to already. 

Final Rating: A

##  08: Jaubi - Nafs at Peace
![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dbqgwcoce/image/upload/v1645118562/nafs_er88hd.png)

Run Time: 42 min  
Genre(s): Jazz Fusion, Hindustani Classical Music, South Asian Folk Music  
Energy Level: ★★

Jaubi (pronounced jaw-be) is a Pakistani based experimental jazz group. Apparently, Jaubi means "whatever" in Urdu. I think this both perfectly encapsulates the band's sound on one hand, while being the complete opposite of the band's sound at the same time. For one, "whatever" feels right because Nafs at peace just about puts whatever sounds good together. Pakistani folk, hindustani folk, (neo)classical, soul and jazz-fusion. The band plays whatever sounds good, and crosses some daring genre boundaries to do it. On the other hand, the album is anything but "whatever" when you listen to it. The absolute energy, the dynamics, just the way Jaubi get into their own playing. It's impressive. 

The album has the perfect jazz balance between bops, downtime and experimental showing off. The moment a boppy tune becomes repetitive, they throw in a beautiful slow part, to then tie it back together with an experimental solo. 

Final Rating: A

##  07: Sufjan Stevens & Angelo De Augustine - A Beginner's Mind
![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dbqgwcoce/image/upload/v1645120050/stevens_tkrypc.png)

Run Time: 45 min  
Genre(s): Indie Folk, Chamber Folk, Singer-Songwriter  
Energy Level: ★★

How do you review an artist with a legendary status like Sufjan Stevens? Sufjan Stevens is to indie folk what Mozart is to classical music. Sure, there is plenty other stuff out there, but for most people, Sufjan Stevens **is** indie folk music just like how mozart is synonymous with classical music. 

So what can I say then? Sufjan Stevens teamed up with Angelo De Augustine to record A Beginner's Mind, a film themed album where each song is inspired by a different film. It's a fun little thing to do while listening to this album: figure out if you know the movie its inspired by. Other than that, it sounds very much like the legendary indie folk Stevens is known for. Bottom line: A must listen for fans of indie folk music.

Final Rating: A

##  06: Floating Points, Pharoah Sanders & The London Symphony Orchestra - Promises
![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dbqgwcoce/image/upload/v1645120637/promises_dmpvif.png)

Run Time: 47 min  
Genre(s): Third Stream, Jazz, Classical, Minimalism, Ambient, Electronic  
Energy Level: ★

Okay, this collab is very weird in its inception. Floating Points is a well known electronic artist, Pharaoh Sanders is a legendary saxophonist, and the LSO are one of the most well known classical music orchestras. I really wonder who decided to put these entities together, but here they are, and they made Promises.

The album is split up in nine movements, each vaguely using the same melody, yet totally reworking it in different ways. Promises then, is 47 minutes that revolve around this simple motif, and yet it explores so many different spaces and feels like a journey, often fragile and calm but especially in the second half this journey gets to grand peaks, always very beautiful and soothing. By the time you think you're tired of motif, something gets done with it and the whole soundscape gets transformed yet again by the three artists.

There is definitely something otherwordly enchanting about it, which not many albums can match. For me, Pharoah Sanders is the star of this album. The way he plays his heart out over the work Floating Points and the LSO put as a foundation is absolutely incredible. 

Must listen for anybody with functioning ears.

Final rating: A+


##  05: sonhos tomam conta - Hypnagogia
![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dbqgwcoce/image/upload/v1645119087/sonhos_zmcqfg.png)

Run time: 41 min  
Genre(s): Blackgaze, Shoegaze, Emo, Post-Rock, Ambient  
Energy Level: ★★★

I think to do this album justice I need to talk a bit about the meaning of it and the background of it. 

In the medical world, hypnagogia is the transitory state between falling asleep and waking up. Due to the brain having a hard time staying in this often disorienting state for so long, hallucinations and heavy lucid dreaming are frequent. This is what this album sounds like. The moment those lush soundscapes in the opener "
Alprazolam vs. vinho barato vs. 6 da manhã" start washing over you, you feel it. Conta herself also describes the album like this: "This is where this album stands; an attempt to recreate the colors and atmosphere of the last state of consciousness that I could take," (taken from the Sonhos tomam conta Bandcamp page)

I think this can also be seen in the lyrical content of the album. The lyrical topics can be rather triggering as they mostly concern suicidal thoughts and self hatred related to LGBT+ issues. They're heart wrenching and put in context with the words above, even moreso. A common recurring theme is sleep, and wanting to go back to sleep. And wanting to keep sleeping forever. Suicidal ideation runs through the album, making the whole thing extremely emotional. You hear it as well in the heart-rending vocals.Finally, to get back to hypnagogia as a theme, the idea of life being hypnagogia is then not only an instrumental theme on the album, but also a lyrical one:

"Maybe I'm still alive  
I couldn't tell if so  
My life is a lucid dream  
That got too numb"  

Final Rating: A+

##  04: McKinley Dixon - For My Mama and Anyone Who Look Like Her
![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dbqgwcoce/image/upload/v1645122312/fmm_xlo3tq.png)

Run time: 47 mins  
Genre(s): Hiphop, Jazz  
Energy Level: ★★★

Jazz-Rap's finest. Bops from start to finish and it doesn't let up. Just listen to it.


Final Rating: A+


##  03: For Those I Love - For Those I Love

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dbqgwcoce/image/upload/v1645121533/FTIL_jco2rx.png)


Run Time: 46 min
Genre(s): Progressive House, Slam Poetry, Spoken Word, Downtempo, sound collage  
Energy Level: ★★★

If you're looking at the genre tags and are confused, then you wouldn't be the first. When I first heard this album I was also confused. How can house music and slam poetry coexist in the same space? Well, For Those I love pulls this blend of genres off seemlessly in this album. 

To me, this album is not an S tier album because of its instrumentals (which are great, mind you!), but because of its lyrics. For Those I Love is the most emotionally vulnerable piece of music dealing with the grief of loss I have heard. The whole album tells a story. A story of dealing with loss, a story of memories long gong but still cherished, a story of a best friend who took his own life and a story of a struggle to come to terms with it and the questions left. The album also has a few voice recordings of the friendgroup from when times were simpler and happier. The soundcollage made from these recordings of these guys just having fun makes it all so real and visceral when confronted with the reality. 

And throughout the album there will be signs of positivity. You think it might be optimistic. And you think there might be peace at the end of it all. And maybe there is, I can't say. But in the first song we have a love that never fades, and by the last song we have a love that's full of pain. 

Final Rating: S

##  02: Lingua Ignota - Sinner Get Ready

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dbqgwcoce/image/upload/v1645126174/lingua_wrci3z.png)

Run Time: 55 min  
Genre(s): Neoclassical Darkwave, Avant-Folk, Chamber Music  
Energy Level: ???


##  01: Black Country, New Road - For The First Time
![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dbqgwcoce/image/upload/v1645126179/ftft_uh2gxh.png)

Run Time: 40 min  
Genre(s): Experimental Rock, Post-Punk, Klezmer, Jazz  
Energy Level: ★★★
