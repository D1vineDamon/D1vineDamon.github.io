### 21: Billie Eilish - Happier Than Ever

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dbqgwcoce/image/upload/v1645002311/550x551_ot6ghz.png)

Run Time: 56 min  
Genre(s): Pop, R&b, Ambient, Electronic

Happier Than Ever is a great follow up to Eilish's debut album and expands upon the same sounds present there, whilst still switching things up enough to be a breath of fresh air. The album consists of amazing pop bops, mellow r&b and ballads, sometimes crossing over into eachother in the very same song. Eilish really leans more into r&b in this album, with some mellow vocals and synthpop base present every other track. The album is less bombastic than her previous one, but in a good way. It might sound like the album is playing it safe, but there's definitely some pretty unique experimental soundscapes for a pop-record. The opener: "I didn't change my number" is a statement to this, ending the track with some really ominous, distorted synths which clash with the mellow sound of the rest of the song. There's also plenty of pretty ballads present here. 

The album suffers slightly from repetitiveness due to its long runtime of 56 min. Especially some of the ballads were redundant in my opinion.

Final rating: B+  
Favorite Songs: I didn't change my number, Billie Bossa Nova, My future, OverHeated, NDA

### 20: Slow Crush - Hush

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dbqgwcoce/image/upload/v1645003844/slowcrush_cu6dbm.png)

Run Time: 45 min  
Genre(s): Rock, Shoegaze, Dream Pop

Hush is the second album by thee Belgian based shoegaze band; Slow Crush. Following up their beloved debut album, Aurora, Slow Crush swings for the fences with Hush, leaning more heavily into the slowcore and dream pop elements of their music, giving us a serene soundscape. In return they forego some of their punk influences, resulting in a much mellower album. I must admit, I miss a little of that punk edge which was present in Aurora, now only present in one song, Swoon. 

Your stomach for meandering, reverb laden waves of sound washing over you will determine if you'll enjoy this album. At the very least I recommend giving the title track: Hush a listen. I feel like I can just about drown in that one. 

Final Rating: A-  
Favorite Songs: Hush, Swoon, Lull, Blue, Gloom

### 19: Blu - The Color Blu(e)

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dbqgwcoce/image/upload/v1645005726/blu_edasns.png)

Run Time: 43 min  
Genre(s): Hiphop, Jazz-Rap

No, I did not mess up the resolution, the albumcover is just blurry.

What is there to say about Blu that hasn't been said before? He's been a big name in the abstract hiphop scene since 2007 and keeps impressing and improving. The Color Blu(e) is just a crispy and plain fun hiphop album. Blu's rapping prowess is up there amongst the best, his lyrics are fun as heck and his production is just a-m-a-z-i-n-g. The jazz-influences in his songs are tasty and not overbearing, and range from subtle moody horn to full on swing quartet. 

I suppose in the end we must ask ourselves only two questions when it comes to this album: 
How did this man:
1) Clear a Beatles sample for this album?
2) and make it absolutely slap in a hiphop context?

Final Rating: A-  
Favorite Songs: People Call Me Blu(e), Because The Sky Is Blu(e), Everyday Blu(e)s, Mr. Blu(e)

### 18: Weezer - OK Human

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dbqgwcoce/image/upload/v1645006335/weezer_lu0con.png)

Run Time: 30 min  
Genre(s): Pop, Rock

No, it doesn't sound anything like OK computer.

Anyways, one second: WEEZER IS BACK, BABYYYY.

Honestly, this is just a short and sweet little pop project, tastefully executed by one of the most cherished poprock bands in the world. What more can you ask for? Some tasty guitars, synths and violins, paired with Cuomo's (somehow!) never ageing voice. The lyrics are fun and simple, just like they were in 1994. Listen to this if you just want to have a good time.

Final Rating: A-  
Favorite Songs: Numbers, Grapes Of Wrath, Aloo Gobi, Playing My Piano, Here Comes The Rain

### 17: Godspeed You! Black Emperor - G_d's Pee AT STATE'S END!

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dbqgwcoce/image/upload/v1645006853/GY_BE_pdlovu.png)

Run Time: 52 Min  
Genre(s): Post-Rock, Ambient, Drone, Field Recording

GY!BE have succeed again in creating a soundtrack for the apocalypse. Not many bands can claim the legendary status of Godspeed You! Black Emperor, having released some of the most critically acclaimed rock albums of the late 90s and early 2000s and paving the way for the future of the whole genre of post-rock.

This album is a bit on the lighter side compared to their old stuff, taking more influences from traditional rock and blues into their music, and sparsing out the post-crock crescendo's with some ambient and field recording material. Therefore it's definitely a good entry point for people not accustomed with them or post-rock in general. By far the best song on the album is the dark and brooding: GOVERNMENT CAME. It just hits that spot their first two albums did, and especially gives an F#A#infinity vibe. Some tracks such as First Of The Last Glaciers even have a surprisingly 70's prog and pysch rock sound to them. All around a great album with many different stylistic influences and a good return to form.

Final Rating: A-  
Favorite Songs: GOVERNMENT CAME, Job’s Lament, First of the Last Glaciers, cliffs’ gaze at empty waters’ rise

### 16: Bastarda & João de Sousa - Fado


![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dbqgwcoce/image/upload/v1645093745/fado_btg99e.png)

Run Time: 43 min  
Genre(s): Chamber Music, Portuguese Folk Music, Fado, Modern Classical

Composer Bastarda and guitarist and vocalist De Sousa have made quite the incredible arrangement on this album. A calm but ominous Fado styled folk album, with lush strings giving the whole album a much grander scale. The elements of modern classical are subdued, but very pleasant to the ears. Though for me, clarinetists Michał Górczyński and Paweł Szamburski are the real stars of this album. I'd never really paid much mind to the bass and contrabass clarinet, but this album made me fall in love with the sound of them. The only real complaint I have with this album is the volume mixing, with some songs ranging from being hardly audible to blowing-out-your-eardrums. Not all of the songs have this problem, but at least a few do.

Final Rating: A-  
Favorite Songs: Livre, Estranha De Vida, Cantiga De Amigo, Medo

### 15: Pærish - Fixed It All

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dbqgwcoce/image/upload/v1645094806/paerish_chgnjb.png)

Run Time: 39 min  
Genre(s): Pop Punk

Pop-Punk? In this economy?!

Yes, apparently good pop-punk can exist beyond the early 2000's. I'm not an angsty teenager today, so I can't truly sing my heart out to edgy lyrics anymore, at least not shamelessly. The sound of pop-punk however is one I come back to every once in a while just for the fun of it.

First of all this album is just that, fun. Is it tacky? Sure. Is it borrowing from every other pop-punk song in existence? Sure, but you can't expect every pop-punk album to be as groundbreaking as The Black Parade. Then what is this album? This album just throws bop after bop at you unapologically, taking all the best parts of pop-punk and combining them. If anything what sets it apart against most pop-punk nowadays is that it feels genuine. It doesn't really feel like as soulless nostalgia bait, but rather as an homage to the genre. The instrumentation is lush and surprisingly complex in certain solos. Sometimes I even get a little jpunk vibes from the guitar, like in the song "Water Doctor". I think what will make or break the album for you is the vocals. I wasn't sold on them immediately, finding them a little bland, but they really grew on me overtime. 

Final Rating: A-  
Favorite Songs: Archives, Journey Of The Prairie King, Albert Suffers, Water Doctor

### 14: Alfa Mist - Bring Backs

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dbqgwcoce/image/upload/v1645095226/alfamist_zgyyf9.png)

Run Time: 39 min  
Genre(s): Jazz-Fusion, Neosoul

Alfa Mist? More like Alfa doesn't miss.

Jokes aside, Alfa Mist just keeps Jazz-fusion sounding fresh and accessible at the same time. I appreciate that Bring Backs, whilst showing apt amounts of technical skill, does not fall into the sound of excess which jazz-fusion often does. Nowhere in the album do I have to sit through 20 minutes of saxophone, piano and guitar fighting for best solo. I think the only song which I found a bit too busy and masturbatory was the opening song, "Teki". Except for that one, I can listen to the album in the background for low concentration tasks as well as the foreground, which is a feat not much jazz-fusion manages to accomplish (or doesn't want to accomplish). 

So that must mean it's boring? Not at all. It's definitely subdued, but it's fresh, complex and sounds new.

Final Rating: A-  
Favorite Songs: All  
Least Favorite Song: Teki
